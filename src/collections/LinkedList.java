/**
 * LinkedList.java - an implementation of a linked list abstract (advanced)
 * data (dynamic) type (ADT) and useful methods. A linked list is a collection
 * of data objects "linked together" and where each object maintains a 
 * reference (a "pointer") to the next object in the list. This is different 
 * from an array where we have one identifier referencing all the items. This 
 * is useful because each object (each spot) is connected to the next spot 
 * like a chain. If we also use each "spot" to store data, we have a structure
 * like an array that stores multiple data items, but where we can add and 
 * remove "spots" from the chain. It could be "visualized" as:
 * 
 *             +------+       +------+       +------+       +------+      
 *  null <---- |      | <---- |      | <---- |      | <---- |      |  
 *             | NODE |       | NODE |       | NODE |       | NODE |       
 *             |      |---->  |      |---->  |      |---->  |      |----> null  
 *             +------+       +------+       +------+       +------+      
 *                 ^                                           ^
 *                 |                                           |
 *                head                                        tail
