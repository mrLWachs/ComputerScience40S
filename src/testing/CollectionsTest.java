        // add and remove items from as we "use" the structure. Data 
        // (information) is stored ("remembered") in a "structure" that you 
        // first learn can be a variable, then more complicated "structures" 
        // like arrays and classes. A static data structure (like variables and
        // arrays) have a fixed size amount as the memory is allocated 
        // (assigned) at compile time. A dynamic data structure (like the ones 
        // we will study in this unit, and others) has a changing size that can
        // grow and shrink at run time. Static data structures can be faster 
        // and easier to implement. Dynamic data structures are more flexible 
        // and manage memory better
