 * Sports.java - the interface for "sports". An interface is a "category" of 
 * abstract concepts. Even more abstract than a abstract class, it can be 
 * thought of as "a set of rules". It is a bit like a class, except it
 * can only contain method signatures (no method body, only the name, 
 * return type, and any parameters) and properties marked as final. 
 * They use the 'interface' modifier keyword instead of 'class'. You 
 * cannot create instances of an interface by itself, you must always 
 * create an instance of some class that 'implements' the interface. This 
 * means the other class "follows the rules" of that interface.
