/**
 * HighSchool.java - represents a high school student person. Before creating
 * this class we altered the NetBeans template (Tools - Templates) for a 
 * Java class so that the toString(), clone(), and equals() methods are now 
 * always part of any new class we create (whether or not we choose to over-ride
 * those methods).
 *
 * This class was later marked as a "abstract class" by adding the "abstract"
 * modifier word to the class signature line (below). An abstract class is a 
 * class which cannot be instantiated – in other words, you define it as a 
 * class but cannot use it to create an object. The purpose of doing this is 
 * to create a class which acts as a parent class (base class) for 
 * subclasses (child classes) but will not be needed to be instantiated 
 * in itself – it must be extended and its methods implemented. Once you 
 * have a abstract class, you can create abstract methods within the 
 * abstract class
