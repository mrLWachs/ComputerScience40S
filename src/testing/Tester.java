/**
 * Tester.java - tests the concepts learned in all the units. It also 
 * introduces the concept of Unit testing. This is a larger concept in
 * Computer Science, but it basically a way of testing a unit (which tries to 
 * be the smallest piece of code that you can isolate). It relates to larger 
 * concepts like "TDD" (test driven development), "JUnit" (testing for the 
 * Java programming language), etc. More can be researched here:
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing
 * And it will come up more if you continue your studies in Computer Science 
 * beyond high school.
