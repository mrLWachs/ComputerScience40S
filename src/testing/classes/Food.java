 * Food.java - abstract class representing the 'concept' of food, an abstract
 * class cannot ever be instantiated (no objects of this class can be created),
 * but can act as a parent class to children classes. Once a class has been 
 * made abstract then you can add abstract methods to the class (regular 
 * methods and regular properties can be added as well). Abstract methods 
 * CANNOT be added to regular classes (once a method is abstract, the entire
 * class must be an abstract class).
