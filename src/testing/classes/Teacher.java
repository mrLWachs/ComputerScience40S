     * types, as they are more complicated than variables (which are "simple" 
     * or "primitive" data types). Array names are usually "plural" words. 
     * When arrays are first created, they are empty. This array will be an 
     * array of student objects, so the teacher "has a" association with these 
     * objects, or it is "composed of" (composition) student objects stored in 
     * the array.
