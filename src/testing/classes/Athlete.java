/**
 * Athlete.java - represents a Athlete Husky HighSchool Student Person. Using 
 * the keyword 'implements' in the class signature line, means this class 
 * "follows the rules" of that interface. This will force the programmer to
 * 'implement' (write) the abstract methods the were 'suggested' in that
 * interface. This can be done in NetBeans with the light bulb. You can 
 * implement ("follow the rules of") MULTIPLE interfaces (this cannot be done
 * with classes - one class can only inherit/extends from one other class). To
 * do multiple implementation, use a comma between interfaces.
