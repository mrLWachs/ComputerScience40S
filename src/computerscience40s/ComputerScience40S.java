// NETBEANS TIPS:
// ==============
// (1)  To zoom in and out on the code, hold ALT and roll the mouse
// (2)  Double click the top of a tab to hide side windows or show them
// (3)  The curly brackets (braces, parenthesis) are important "{" and "}"
// (4)  Click the green triangle on the top toolbar to run code
// (5)  Type "sout" and then press tab it fills (autocompletes) "System.out..."
// (6)  Autocomplete (Intellisense) can appear if you press "CTRL + SPACE"
// (7)  The word "null" means "nothing" and can act as a placeholder for code
//      you often do not need (right now)
// (8)  To "comment out" chunks of code, select the code with your mouse or 
//      keyboard, then click on the two buttons under the code tab (on right)
// (9)  To stop a running program, click the red stop button on the left in the
//      output window, or the X in the bottom right of NetBeans
// (10) A red squiggily line and/or a "lightbulb" in NetBeans means a potential
//      error and a potential fix (if you click on the lightbulb)
// (11) You can get more NetBeans tips and autocompletes by selecting:
//      Help -> Keyboard Shortcuts Card
// (12) Go to Tools -> Templates, scroll down and click on the "+" beside 
//      "Java", select "Java Main Class", and "Open in Editor" and the enter 
//      this into the temple (but use the slash "/" instead of "|"):
//
//      /** 
//       * ${name}.java - 
//       *
//       * @author Mr. Wachs 
//       * @since ${date} 
//       */
//      public class ${name} 
//       { .... etc .....     
//
// (13) To autoformat code (fixes indents, extra spaces, etc.) you select the
//      code with mouse or keyboard (if you select nothing it will autoformat
//      all the code) and pres ALT + SHIFT + F (you should do this before you 
//      hand in your code)
// (14) When printing code for hand in (this only needs to be done once), click
//      on "Print Options" and uncheck everything previously checked off, and
//      then check off "Print as in Editor", then either print it to a PDF 
//      (which means select "Microsoft Print to PDF" on the next screen), or
//      cancel and resize the code to fit better (see tip #1) and then print 
//      again
// (15) You can "teach" NetBeans to change the style it uses to autoformat (see
//      number 13) by going to Tools -> Options, then click on the "Editor"
//      tab at the top, then the "Formatting" below that. Then change the 
//      settings to what you prefer
// (16) The + and - signs and gray lines along the side in NetBeans
//      help to "expand" and "collapse" the method body (block of code)
//      press CTRL and SHIFT and "-" it collapses all methods, and
//      CTRL and SHIFT and "+" expands all code folds
// (17) If you hold down the CTRL key, method calls become links with the
//      mouse to jump to the method (even ones we don't write)
// (18) If you write the "call" to a method, before writing the method 
//      itself, the lightbulb (see tip 10) will help you write it
// (19) On the left side window, the Navigator window helps find and jump to
//      methods if you double click them
// (20) If you have to rename a variable or a method, select the word (the name
//      of the variable or method) and then press CTRL + R, then type in a
//      new name
// (21) If you type /** before the method signature line it will automate
//      which JavaDoc comments you should make
// (22) If you want to remove the auto-generated reminder when you use the
//      lightbulb to create a method, go to Tools -> Templates, scroll down 
//      and click on the "+" beside "Java", and then the "+" beside "code
//      snippets", and select "Generated Method body" and remove the last line
// (23) All arrays have a ".length" feature built in that you can have NetBeans
//      autocomplete for you by typing the name of your array, then dot length
//      (".length") which automatically gives you how many elements are in
//      the array
// (24) When writing for loops with array, if you type "for" then press TAB, 
//      and then press TAB AGAIN it jump to the ending value (which should be 
//      the ".length" of the array (so if the array size changes, the loop 
//      adapts to it) - the loop variable "i" also represents the array "index"
// (25) To view the same code editing window with two different views, go to
//      the menu View -> Split -> Vertical (or Horizontal) and Clear when done
